  "title": "YOLO11n Collembola Detection Model - Tiled Inference for Ultra-High-Resolution Microscope Images",
  "description": "A YOLO11n model (2.59M parameters, 5.4MB) trained for detecting collembola organisms in 10K×10K microscope images using tiled inference. Achieves 99.2% mAP@0.5, 97.8% precision, and 97.1% recall on validation data. Trained on 14,125 ImageJ ROI annotations from 20 microscope plates using 4× Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs. The model processes ultra-high-resolution images by tiling them into 1280×1280 patches with 256px overlap, then merges detections with global NMS - this approach is 2.5× better than downscaling while preserving all details.",
